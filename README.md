# Energy-Management-Optimisation

# Basic Overview : 

Energy management includes generation, storage, demand and ramp rate.

It is very important to meet the demand and prevent any power blackouts
It should be ensured that at any given point of time, over production of energy which cannot be stored does not happen
Finally, the generators capacity can be increased and decreased based on a ramp rate.
